Morpheus 0.0.6 Version Release Notes: Mac + Linux + Windows Installs
This is the first version of Morpheus that brings together an open source LLM (defaults to Llama2) + connecting a user's Meta Mask wallet + executing on chain transactions via a ETH focused Smart Agent.

**After connecting Morpheus to your Meta Mask, you can test it by taking basic actions such as:**
 - "What is my balance?" 
 - "What is my address?" 
 - "Send ETH to Ethereum
   Address"

Morpheus doesn't have a connection to a block explorer or price oracles yet, so it can't answer general transactions questions. It just answers the above examples based on info from the Meta Mask wallet you connect.
Warnings:
- Review all transactions before approving them. The LLM makes mistakes, you have human wisdom.
- Seriously, double check all actions in the Meta Mask interface before sending money.
- This is an experimental release and the ETH Smart Agent may try and send your money into a black hole. 
- Gas costs are high on Ethereum. Consider testing out 0.0.6 using the Sepolia testnet or Arbitrum.

**Linux: There are now two linux builds (RPM and DEB)**
